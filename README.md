Spatio-Temporal Approach to Credit Card Fraud Detection in the US with Machine Learning Applications

In the digital age, the rise in electronic financial transactions has been paralleled by a surge in fraudulent activities, presenting a significant challenge to financial security. This research introduces a spatio-temporal approach to fraud detection in the US, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict fraudulent transactions. By integrating spatial, temporal, and social features, the study evaluates the performance of Random Forests, LightGB, and XGBoost classifiers using a comprehensive dataset of financial transactions. The methodology involves detailed feature engineering, including social, temporal, and spatial characteristics, and utilizes the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) for spatio-temporal clustering. The findings highlight the efficacy of combining spatio-temporal analysis with machine learning to enhance fraud detection systems. The optimal model, a weighted combination of LightGBM and XGBoost, achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.91%, precision of 83.45%, recall of 93.65%, F1 score of 88.26%, and ROC-AUC of 99.94%, significantly surpassing individual model performances.
